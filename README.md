## Guide on How to Create a New Environment

### Creating a Virtual Environment

1. **Install virtualenv (Optional):** If not already installed, you can install `virtualenv` for additional features:

    ```bash
    pip install virtualenv
    ```

2. **Create the Virtual Environment:**

    - Using `venv` (recommended for Python 3.3 and above):

        ```bash
        python -m venv myenv
        ```

    - Using `virtualenv`:

        ```bash
        virtualenv myenv
        ```

    Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On Unix or MacOS:

        ```bash
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
