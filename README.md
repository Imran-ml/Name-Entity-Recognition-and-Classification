## Introduction

This repository hosts the implementation and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at interpreting doctor notes through Name Entity Recognition (NER) and Classification techniques. The objective is to categorize medical notes into "Others" and "Syndrome" to facilitate quicker and more accurate healthcare decisions.

## Environment Setup

**Prerequisites**: Ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed on your system.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Install `virtualenv` if you prefer it over the built-in `venv` (optional):
        ```bash
        pip install virtualenv
        ```
    - Create the environment:
        - With `venv` (Python 3.3+):
            ```bash
            python -m venv env
            ```
        - Or, with `virtualenv`:
            ```bash
            virtualenv env
            ```
    - Activate the environment:
        - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
        - Unix/MacOS: `source env/bin/activate`
    - To deactivate: `deactivate`

2. **Dependencies**:
    Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Conclusion

We applied various techniques in data preparation and feature extraction. Initially, using the TF-IDF technique for feature extraction did not yield satisfactory results. However, switching to a Sequence extractor using TensorFlow significantly improved our outcomes. Data preprocessing, feature extraction, and hyperparameter tuning were crucial in enhancing the RNN's performance, whereas the Random Forest model underperformed.

For hyperparameter tuning in deep learning models, it's essential to adjust them based on the problem at hand, train, and test the model to evaluate its performance thoroughly. In the case of the Random Forest model, employing a GRID SEARCH approach allows for training across a spectrum of hyperparameters to identify the optimal ones for the final model.

### Hyperparameters for RNN:
After tuning, the optimal hyperparameters included using the Sigmoid activation function for binary output, binary cross-entropy for a two-class classification problem, and the RMSPROP optimizer for enhanced performance. Experimenting with different epochs and batch sizes, we found that 20 epochs and a batch size of 500 were ideal.

### Hyperparameters for RF:
The best parameters for the Random Forest model were identified through grid search, resulting in: {'n_estimators': 200, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'max_depth': 8, 'criterion': 'gini'}.

The RNN model excelled due to its capability to remember information from previous instances, providing superior results.
